PROJECT 1 - MEXICO HOUSING PROJECT

In this project, I'll work with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website Properati.com. My goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

Some of the things I'll learn in this project are:

How to organize information using basic Python data structures.

How to import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library.

How to create data visualizations like scatter and box plots.

How to examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.

The project consists of four lessons and one assignment. I'll work through the lessons following WordQuant Instructor  code-along videos.
